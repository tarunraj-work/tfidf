US6240432B1 (Enhanced random number generator),In this invention is described a linear feedback shift register that is enhanced with XOR circuits and free running oscillators to maximize the random nature of the sequence of digital bit created at the output of the generator in response to a clock signal. XOR circuits are included in the feedback path of a LFSR to randomize digital signals being fed back from the output to the input. Additional XOR circuits are interposed between stages of the LFSR and each connected to a high frequency oscillator to randomize the digital signals flowing between stages of the LFSR. The frequency of the oscillators are set so as not to be duplicated, and not to be a factor or multiple of another oscillator connected to the enhanced LFSR. The frequency of the oscillators are higher than the frequency of the clock used to step the LFSR. The output of the LFSR is a highly randomized sequence of digital bits that can be used in integrated circuits for such purposes as Smart Cards.

The random number generator disclosed employs a white noise source to clock a counting arrangement whose maximum count exceeds the largest random number desired. A variable counter, clocked at a fixed rate, is loaded with random numbers obtained from the counting arrangement and each time the variable counter is counted down to a threshold state a new random number is read from the counting arrangement. Random numbers obtained in this mamner are then checked to ascertain their propriety and those which are accepted are then subjected to pseudo-random number regenerative techniques to further randomize the same. The resulting random numbers are then employed within a digitally controlled and operated gaming machine to select winning condition, the probabilities to be displayed during periods when wagers are accepted and otherwise to vary initial conditions associated with the gaming event prior to the actual occurrence thereof. The gaming event is then visually displayed in accordance with the winning conditions selected and any successful wagers are paid.

US4905176A (Random number generator circuit),A very large scale integrated (VLSI) compatible, random number generator which is highly invulnerable to cryptographic attack. The invulnerability to cryptographic attack is based upon a low frequency sampling of the output of a pseudo-random number generator which is operated at a varying frequency from a free-running ring oscillator. In a first embodiment, a free-running ring oscillator is used to drive a sampled linear feedback shift register. The asynchronous, serial pseudo-random number output from the linear feedback shift register is sampled periodically, thereby introducing randomly occurring deviations from the pseudo-random number sequence. A variation of the free-running ring oscillator is employed as the pseudo-random number generator, by introducing into the feedback loop of the ring oscillator, an exclusive OR circuit which is connected so that the ring oscillator thereby produces a serial, pseudo-random number sequence. Additional uncertainty in the sequence of random numbers produced by the free-running pseudo-random number generator, is caused by the race condition which occurs at the inputs to the exclusive OR connected in the circuit.
